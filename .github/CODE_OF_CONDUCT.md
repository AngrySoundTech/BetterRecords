# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
We ask that the following guidelines are observed in the interest of creating a positive environment.

Examples of behavior that create a positive environment include:

* Being welcoming
* Being respectful of differing views and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include, but are not limited to:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Other conduct which could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior
and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, wiki edits, issues,
and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team,
or to any of the appointed community moderators. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in
a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obliged to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
